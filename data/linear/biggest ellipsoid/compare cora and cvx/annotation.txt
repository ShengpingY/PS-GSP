after trying to find outthe biggest ellipsoid in the polyhedron, 
we got the matrix of ellipsoid B and d, but when trying to represent this ellipsoid with CORA package it's not 
accurate, the ellipsoid with red dash line is the biggest enclosed in polyhedron, the blue one is obviously wrong
and when trying to change ellipsoid into zonotope it's an overapproximation which is obviously what we want
